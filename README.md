# Graph-RPI: Reproduction of Experimental Results

This repository provides the full codebase and data required to reproduce all results presented in our paper on **Graph-RPI**, a graph-based model for RNAâ€“protein interaction (RPI) prediction. It includes the implementation of the proposed method, multiple baseline methods, ablation studies, interpretability analysis, and evaluation under five-fold cross-validation. The goal is to ensure the reproducibility and transparency of every analysis in the article.

The repository contains the following components:

- **Ablation experiments**: Includes scripts to evaluate the effect of different design choices such as feature fusion strategies (`different feature fusion.py`), GNN variants (`different GNN layers.py`), negative sampling strategies (`different negative sampling strategies.py`), masking ratio and alpha hyperparameters (`mask ratio and alpha value settings.py`), and supervised vs. self-supervised regimes (`supervised and self-supervised regimes.py`).

- **Comparison methods**: Provides implementations or wrappers for multiple RPI or LPI prediction baselines, including `LPI-CNNCP`, `LPI-SKMSC`, `RPI-CapsGAN`, `RPI-MDLStack`, and `RPISeq`. These methods are evaluated under the same datasets and cross-validation settings for fair comparison.

- **Five-fold cross-validation data**: Contains predefined fold partitions for all datasets used in the paper. These folds are used consistently across all models to ensure a fair and replicable evaluation.

- **Model interpretability analysis**: Includes scripts for SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis based on the Captum library. These scripts help identify which RNA and protein features are most influential in the Graph-RPI predictions.

- **Similarity**: Contains clustering code and similarity matrices used to construct more stringent data splits and validate model generalization beyond sequence similarity.

- **train_test data**: Stores the original benchmark RPI datasets used for training and testing.
